# My code for the Kaggle competition Starship-Titanic.
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview

Summary:
To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported 
by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.

My code uses an ensamble of a Random Forest and a Neural Network.
The data was cleaned by removing columns that did not improve the model. 
Gaps in the dataset were iteratively filled using predictions from the Random Forest.
